          <p>
            I am a 26year old girl in Cape Town, I am passionate about solving problems and willing to learn. 2016 July, I decided to try coding at CodeSpace, it was totally a new thing to me but I really had a great time playing around css animations and I ended up developing more interest in Front-end web development.
            After my course completion, I was placed as a front end developer intern at Native VML in Cape Town, that's where I have grown and developed more love and interest in Front end because of the daily creative and inspirational work that was developed by the senior developers everyday.
